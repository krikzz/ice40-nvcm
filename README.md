# ice40-nvcm
 ICE40 NVCM programming protocol.<br/>
 Program your ICE40 without proprietary lattice tools! This class implements the MVCM memory programming protocol for ICE40 fpga. I only used it for the ICE40HX1K, but with minimal modifications it will probably work for any other ICE40x chips. <br/>
 To use this class, you need to implement an interface to your USB-to-SPI device (Linker).
